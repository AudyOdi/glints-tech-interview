To run each file, type `node <file_name>.js` in your terminal. Please make sure you have at least Node version 8.x.x.

In each file, there is a test case section (at the bottom of the file), which will execute all the test cases and show the results in your terminal. You can also add your own test case there.

For `matrixRotator.js` file, there is no test case section (not sure how to test it unless you see the actual output array). But you can try it by simply call the `matrixRotator` function and it will show you the rotated matrix in your terminal.

Time to finish each task:

- factorial: 5 minutes
- sort array: 40 minutes
- matrix rotator: 1 hour
